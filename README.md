# 100railsZohoCode
A repo for zoho functions that are common usage.

These functions are EXAMPLES only of how you can connect to the Zoho writer solution from Zoho creator.
There is also an image of the table design we use to store settings
AND some template examples and raw JSON that we have used to create the link.
